# Janet music box poem

**This is the code for the digital interface created for my poem "Instructions for a Butterfly" which was written using the Janet typeface, designed by Kate Sweeney. The interface presents the poem in the typeface, and then periodically switches the case of random characters in the poem. This triggers musical notes to be played, which were recorded by Sweeney from a music box also inspired by the Janet typeface. **

This code repository contains the files for the interface, including the audio files and the typeface, within the 'site_files' folder.
